# 100-Days-Of-Code

| Day | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Learn the basics of Python | Complete |
| 2 | Learn the basics of algorithms and data structures | In progress |
| 3 | Start working on a data structure or algorithm challenge | In progress |
| 4 | Learn the basics of cybersecurity | Not started |

### Goals

* Learn the basics of algorithms and data structures
* Complete the Cybersecurity Beginner to Intermediate with Pen Testing course
* Learn the basics of full stack web development
* Contribute to an open source project

### Notes and reflections

I'm excited to start this 100 days of code challenge! I'm hoping to learn a lot about algorithms and data structures, cybersecurity, and full stack web development.

## 100 Days Schedule

Here is a sample schedule for the above goals:

**Days 1-30:** Learn the basics of algorithms and data structures. You can use a book, online course, or tutorial to learn the basics.

**Days 31-60:** Complete the Cybersecurity Beginner to Intermediate with Pen Testing course. This course will teach you the basics of cybersecurity and pen testing.

**Days 61-90:** Learn the basics of full stack web development. You can use a book, online course, or tutorial to learn the basics.

**Days 91-100:** Contribute to an open source project. This is a great way to learn from others and practice your skills.

This is just a sample schedule, and you can adjust it to fit your own needs and goals. For example, if you have more experience with one topic, you can spend less time on that topic and more time on the other topics.

### Additional Tips

* Use a task management tool to track your progress.
* Set realistic goals for each day or week.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help from others.
* Take breaks when you need them.
* Celebrate your successes!

### Conclusion

I hope this Markdown text and tips help you on your 100 Days of Code journey! Good luck!
